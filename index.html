                    <p>Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate
                        tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used
                        to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.</p>

                        first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many

                    <p>PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic
                        content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. It is integrated with
                        a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and
                        Microsoft SQL Server.</p>

                        programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program
                        objects in a network such as the Internet.</p>
